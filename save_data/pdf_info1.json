Methods: Socio-demographic data, personal and family psychiatric\nhistory, as well as stressful life events during childhood and pregnancy were\nevaluated at baseline.

We investigated serum lactate change prediction using the MIMIC-III\nand eICU-CRD datasets in internal as well as external validation of the eICU\ncohort on the MIMIC-III cohort. Three subgroups were defined based on the\ninitial lactate levels: i) normal group (<2 mmol/L), ii) mild group (2-4\nmmol/L), and iii) severe group (>4 mmol/L).
